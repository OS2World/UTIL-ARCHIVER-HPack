    disk + mailing, around $15.  You don't need to register HPACK to get the
    source code, the charge is simply to cover costs.

    Terms:

    There is no compulsion to register HPACK - this  is  merely  a  way  for
    HPACK  developers  to  recover  the  enormous  amounts of time and money
    which have gone into developing  HPACK,  to  allow  us  to  continue  to
    communicate  with  each  other  via  phone  and  email, and to allow the
    distribution of upgrades, information, and support, for as  little  cost
    as  possible (usually it's free).  However if you're using HPACK as part
    of your work, you really should register it...

    That's all.  No threats.  No caveats. No long-winded list of conditions.
    Enjoy!

    In addition I can also accept  electronic  credit  card  submissions  if
    they are signed by a validated PGP or HPACK public key.
