                         Ideas for HPACK Extensions
                         ==========================

  The following ideas have been proposed as extensions for the basic HPACK
archiver:

 - Have a device driver which makes an HPACK archive seem like a filesystem.
   
 - Have an HPACK daemon which works like a spooler daemon.  Each person has
   in their $HOME a directory called .hpack.  The daemon regularly checks this
   directory and adds/freshens any files it finds in it to some predetermined
   archive.  Thus when working on a project it is possible to keep continuous
   backups of current work.  This idea may be rendered somewhat obsolete by
   tools like SCCS.
   
 - A dead archive resurrector.  Currently it is possible to resurrect archives
   which have been created with the -e option by hand.  A program to do this
   automagically would be interesting, but probably not too useful:  If the
   archive directory (which constitutes a very small portion of the total
   archive) has been zapped then chances are the data (which makes up the bulk
   of the archive) has been zapped as well.
   
 - An idea from Stu (the King of the Pipeline Stalls):  Create a version of 
   HPACK which compresses everything into memory and then executes an illegal
   instruction.  This creates an HPACK archive called "core".  This is very
   versatile, since all you need to do is load the file into adb (the program
   cavemen used to debug fire), patch it, and keep running it in extract mode.
   This makes it possible to extract HPACK archives without a copy  of HPACK.
   (BTW this is the person who thinks the only useful command in UNIX is "dd").
